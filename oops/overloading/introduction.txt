 One thing has different implemnetation
 Example :-
  Male Personality [Cheeku]
    Home :- Son, Husband

---------------------------------------
1. Compile Time Polymorphism / Early Binding
   Method Overloading :-
     When we define multiple method in a class with the same whose parameter are different is called method overloading.

     Way of keeping different parameter
     a. numbers
     b. types
     c. sequence
     Note :- 
     1. In case method overloading return type doesn't matter.
     2. We can overload static & instance method both
2. Runtime polymorphism / Late Binding
